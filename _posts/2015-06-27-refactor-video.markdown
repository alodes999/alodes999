We were assigned a project this week to come up with an idea, make up design and program specs for it, map it out through GitHub issues and Milestones, and then code it up!  My idea was to make a Games Review Repository, a web interface for entering games, their genres and formats, ie video game, board game, etc. With that meant coming up with database tables to store each piece of that information.  One of the steps, after finishing the actual programming and set up part of the table and models and views, was to check for refactoring needs.  I ended up having a decently large list of code I needed to refactor to meet approval.  I made a video discussing these refactoring goals I was given, so here's the video:

The remaining part of the project is to find a Ruby gem or API to plug into our program to allow for some additional functionality and user experience ease.  I couldn't come up with a Ruby Gem to handle plugging in additional game information for the user to see, so I'm going to look for a games data API and see if I can use that information to help aid the UX in some way.

All in all, the project was pretty challenging, not so much for the coding part, but the actual idea brainstorming and the project spec.  The code was a lot of the same idea and modelling we did in our Inventory Manager project, but adapting it for use with a new idea was a bit of a struggle.  I really have enjoyed this project though, and after we use CSS and other things on it in the next few weeks, I'm actually pretty excited to see how it works and looks out in the actual web!
