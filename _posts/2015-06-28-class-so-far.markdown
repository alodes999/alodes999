We've got 8 weeks of class left, and it's a weird feeling knowing our first month is done.  On one hand, there's a lot we've done and learned, and I know personally I've picked up quite a bit, and made huge strides in understanding and being able to use the lingo and dialect like most junior devs would.  On the other hand, there's so much more out there, and I am quite certain we've just scratched the surface of even the stuff we've done so far.  That's the nature of the beast, or so I'm going to believe.  

It's hard to fully accept and believe that what we've done so far is really achievement, and not just some passing phase of imitation.  Yet, that's exactly what we've done.  While we have had help, while we've had Sumeet and Ruthie and Andrew to guide us and correct us, and the rest of the class as extra eyes, as shoulders to lean on, we've built something.  We've taken an idea, and thrown it into tables, into code, into a functional set of files and webpage views.  Something that, while extraordinarily raw, is the foundation, the frame, for something that could be big.  We've actually built something, and thinking about it like that really does make it feel like this could very well be the groundwork for a new and exciting chapter in life.

Leaving the bank on a chance like I did is a pretty scary proposition.  My wife and I are living on one income for the time being, while I take this chance.  It is exciting, and scary all at the same time.  Yet looking at the first month of this class, I have constantly felt, and I still whole-heartedly do feel, that this is the best decision I, and really, we, could have made.  The bank was comfort, a steady entity that, while I wasn't really happy with, I accepted and was more or less content with.  It's best to stretch that comfort though.  It's best to get out and learn and do something that really pushes you outside that comfort zone, to make yourself grow, to make yourself learn new things.  Having the support, the backing, the knowledge I have people in my corner, to do something this, well... crazy, is one of the best parts of this whole experience.  My wife, both sets of our parents, our friends, all are encouraging and supportive, and having all of that behind me while doing this has been nothing short of amazing.

And yet, we still have (only?) 8 weeks left.  8 long, intense, code-filled, mind-bending, frustration-filled weeks ahead of us.  And like the first 4, they are going to go by incredibly fast, blink-and-you'll-miss-it fast.  It's a challenge I want, a challenge I accept, and a challenge that I will complete and become a better person from.

So, 8 weeks, bring it on.  It's 8 weeks I will cherish, for the people in the class, for the instructors, for the new path in life.  8 weeks left.

Bring it on.
